## Project Description
In this project, we will design a career services platform (website) aimed at two main types of clients: job-seeking students and employers. The students will be able to browse and apply to job postings, while the employers will be able to make job postings and seek out candidates. The functionalities of this platform are similiar to that of Concordia's COMPASS platform, but we also implement some unique functionalities. 
Additionally, there will be a third type of user: Administrators, that will serve mostly to moderate the platform and manage it, but are not the main "clients" of this platform.

## Core Features:
Employers:
- Ability to edit their account information - name, email, company information, etc.
- Ability to add, delete and edit job postings 
- View and select candidates in a specific job posting.

Employees: 
- Ability to edit their account information - name, email, current/previous jobs and experience, etc.
- Browse for postings (with perhaps the ability to search/filter postings)
- View a posting:
  - Apply to a posting:
     - Upload cover letter
     - Upload CV
  - Report postings (innapropriate, malicious, etc.)
 
 Admins:
 - Ability to edit/remove postings
 - Ability to edit/remove reported postings
 - Ability to block/remove a user
 
 (Keep in mind that this list may be updated with more features as the project progresses)
