## Project Description
In this project, we will design a career services platform (website) aimed at two main types of clients: job-seeking students and employers. The students will be able to browse and apply to job postings, while the employers will be able to make job postings and seek out candidate. The functionalities of this platform are similiar to that of Concordia's COMPASS platform, but we also implement some unique functionalities.
